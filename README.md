# Extinction-Prediction
Data Science Project<br/>

## Can we predict the extinction of species?

The process of getting the answer is built on several stages which are executed by algorithmic functions in Python:<br/>

ðŸ“¡ **_Getting The Data_** - Crawling and scrapping a data filled web-site.<br/>
ðŸ“‹ **_Data Handling_** - Cleaning corrupt values and filling missing data.<br/>
ðŸ“Š **_Visualization & Analyzation** - Creating a clear way to analyze and show behaviors between the data properties.<br/>
ðŸ¤– **_Machine Learning_** - Creating a trained model which takes the data and predicts if a species will get extinct or not.<br/> 

## Model Accuracy:
Final model accuracy after feature engineering is ``93.96%.``

## Extinct to-be species by the model:
