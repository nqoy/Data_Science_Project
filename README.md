**Can we predict the extintion of species?**  

The process of getting the answer is built on several stages which are executed by algorithmic functions in Python:  

ðŸ“¡ **_Getting The Data_** - Crawling and scrapping a data filled web-site.  
ðŸ“‹ **_Data Handling_** - Cleaning currupt vlaues and filling missing data.  
ðŸ“Š **_Visualization And Analyzation_** - Creating a clearer way to analyze and show the corraletions between its properties.  
ðŸ¤– **_Machine Learning_** - Creating a trained model which takes the data and predicts if a species will get extinct or not.
