Reasech question: Can we predict the extintion of species?  

The process of getting the answer is built on several stages which are executed by algorithmic functions in Python:  

1. **Getting The Data** - Crawling and scrapping a data filled web-site.
2. **Data Handling** - Cleaning currupt vlaues and filling missing data.
3. **Visualization And Analyzation** - Visualizing the data for a clearer way to analyze and show corraletions between its properties.
4. **Machine Learning** - Creating a trained model which takes the data and predicts if a species will get extinct or not.
