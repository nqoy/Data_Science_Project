**Can we predict the extintion of species?**  

The process of getting the answer is built on several stages which are executed by algorithmic functions in Python:  

1. **_Getting The Data_** ðŸŒ±- Crawling and scrapping a data filled web-site.
2. **_Data Handling_** ðŸ”­- Cleaning currupt vlaues and filling missing data.
3. **_Visualization And Analyzation_** âš¡- Visualizing the data for a clearer way to analyze and show corraletions between its properties.
4. **_Machine Learning_**:computer: - Creating a trained model which takes the data and predicts if a species will get extinct or not.
